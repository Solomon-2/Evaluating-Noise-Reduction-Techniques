# Comprehensive Multi-Dimensional Denoising Evaluation Research Plan

## Executive Summary

This research plan outlines a systematic evaluation of denoising methods for smartphone-based sleep apnea detection using classifier-based models (Random Forest). The study addresses the critical gap between laboratory-quality audio processing and real-world deployment constraints, providing practical recommendations for mobile health applications.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Research Question
**"Which audio preprocessing denoising method (spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering, LogMMSE, or deep learning denoisers) provides the optimal balance of detection accuracy, signal quality improvement, computational efficiency, and biomarker preservation for smartphone-based sleep apnea detection using Random Forest classifiers?"**

### Secondary Research Objectives
1. **Multi-Dimensional Performance Analysis**: Evaluate denoising methods across four critical dimensions rather than detection accuracy alone
2. **Smartphone Deployment Feasibility**: Assess computational requirements, processing speed, and memory usage for mobile deployment
3. **Feature Preservation Assessment**: Understand how denoising affects acoustic biomarkers critical for sleep apnea detection
4. **Cross-Noise Robustness**: Evaluate method performance across different noise types and intensity levels
5. **Clinical Translation**: Provide evidence-based recommendations for real-world smartphone app development

## Background and Motivation

### Current State of Sleep Apnea Detection
- **Clinical Need**: Sleep apnea affects 1 billion people globally, with 80% undiagnosed
- **Smartphone Opportunity**: Mobile devices offer accessible screening but face significant audio quality challenges
- **Research Gap**: Most studies focus on clean audio or deep learning approaches unsuitable for mobile deployment

### Technical Challenges Addressed
1. **Noise Contamination**: Real-world recordings contain environmental noise that degrades detection accuracy
2. **Computational Constraints**: Smartphones require lightweight, battery-efficient processing
3. **Feature Stability**: Denoising may inadvertently remove breathing biomarkers essential for detection
4. **Performance Trade-offs**: Balancing noise reduction with preservation of clinical signals
