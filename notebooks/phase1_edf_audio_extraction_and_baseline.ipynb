    "## This Notebook:\n",
    "1. **EDF to WAV Conversion**: Extract audio from clinical EDF files\n",
    "2. **Baseline Model Testing**: Validate trained model on extracted audio\n",
    "3. **Clean Audio Performance**: Establish clean audio baseline metrics\n",
    "4. **Test Set Preparation**: Create standardized test set for noise experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output:\n",
    "- WAV files organized by patient for denoising pipeline\n",
    "- Baseline performance metrics (F1, sensitivity, specificity)\n",
    "- Feature extraction validation\n",
    "- Clean audio test set ready for Phase 2 noise injection\n",
